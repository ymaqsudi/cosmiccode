				<p>Hi, I'm Yaseen! I am an undergraduate student at Stony Brook University, currently
					pursuing a double major in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science. I have a
					strong passion for teaching kids the power of code and have years of experience
					programming in a variety of languages, including C, Java, Python, R, and
					Javascript. I've built games, websites, mobile apps and worked for
					software company Cargo Matrix. </p>
				<p>My background in robotics is strong, as I've programmed four FTC robots,
					including one that competed at the highest level in Houston, Texas. Also, I've
					completed bioinfomatic research on kidney disease, diabetes, and alternative
					herbicides for science journals. I am a strong proponent of bridging the fields
					of natural science and engineering with the software world. I believe the
					applications of coding go far beyond a text editor.</p>
				<p>I've been coding since I was 8 and love sharing my passion for coding with kids. As
					a tutor, I help kids gain valuable coding skills and unlock their full
					potential.</p>

				<p>Welcome to our personalized Python tutoring class! 
				Our 1-on-1 sessions are specifically designed to teach children the fundamental 
				concepts of the Python programming language. Each session will last for approximately 
				one hour and cost $35. To ensure our students benefit from our tutoring program, 
				we offer the first session for free. Our class schedules are flexible, and we will 
				work with you to find a convenient time that suits your schedule. As availability is 
				limited and on a first-come-first-served basis, we encourage you to sign up today to 
				secure your spot!
				</p>
				<p>During each session, kids will learn the basics of Python and work on building
					exciting projects like 2D games, simple websites, and more. Our classes will be
					held over Google Meet to ensure a safe and interactive learning environment. To
					get the most out of our classes, students will need access to a computer and
					will need to install certain software.</p>
				<p>We believe in a hands-on approach to learning, so while there will be minimal
					homework assignments and no exams, we will have project assignments to help
					students digest the material they've been learning. Our goal is to help kids
					discover the fun and creativity of coding while builiding a strong foundation in
					Python.</p>

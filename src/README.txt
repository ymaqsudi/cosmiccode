Welcome to the Cosmic Coding website repository!

I wrote this website using some template code from HTML5UP. The code base is mostly HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Javascript. The images were made public on the web.

The goal of this business is to teach kids how to code through 1 on 1 lessons online. The purpose of my website was to provide a brief introduction to my idea and make it easy for people to sign up and contact me without having too much commitment.
